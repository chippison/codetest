/*RUNNING THE PROGRAM: */
NOTE: Composer dependency manager is needed for this project as we use its autoloader for loading needed classes.
To run the program, simply download the repository to your localhost.

Once project is downloaded, simply run "composer install" to tell composer to get dependent libraries for this project.

After composer finishes downloading needed libraries, you can just call "php src/index.php" on commandline to get output.

You can also run UnitTest to see tests and compare it against expected output from test data
